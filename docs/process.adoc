This document describes the procedure of signing and verifying ELF binaries.

[preface]
== Motivation

Signing executables is often seen a restriction for "just running" an application, centrally controlling of what a
user may, or may not execute.

However, there is a second aspect to it, ensuring that a binary was not altered between the supplier creating the
binary and the user executing it.

The latter part also comes in handy when the user wants to validate metadata attached to the binary, created by the
supplier.

== Goals and non-goals

=== Goals

* Improve the integrity of the file between the process of creating and the moment it is being used
* Provide easy to use tooling to make the effort as seamless as possible
* Allow to enforce additional policies, as configured by the user
* Be able to work offline

=== Non-goals

* Prevent a user from executing code, if that is really the wish of the user

=== Example use cases

Here are a few example use-cases which should be covered by this solution.

==== Ensuring metadata wasn't altered

An author provides additional metadata embedded in the binary (like a `cargo auditable` build). This information is
part if the binary, but not of the code itself.

Validating any information of this only makes sense if it is known that the binary was not altered after the information
was created and embedded into the binary.

==== Ensuring the program logic wasn't altered

Assume a program checking something, printing out "ok" or "not ok" . If someone edited the binary, changing "not ok"
to "ok", the application logic would have been compromised.

== Procedure

This section describes how the procedure should work{empty}footnote:[Most likely the code doesn't work that way, yet! If that is the case, that is a bug!].

[NOTE]
.The use of Sigstore and Rekor
====
Currently, this document assumes that Rekor is being used. It would be good to have additional/alternative
implementations of this part of the process. But right now, the focus is on Sigstore, Fulcio and Rekor
====

=== Adding a signature

Signing the binary consists of the following steps:

* Create a digest of the ELF binary
* Acquire a private key and certificate
* Sign the digest with the private key to generate a signature
* Publish the digest and certificate in a transparency log
* Embed the following information into the ELF binary
  ** Signature
  ** Certificate
  ** Transparency log information

[#creating_a_digest_of_the_elf_binary]
==== Creating a digest of the ELF binary

As adding the signature information will alter the ELF binary, it is not possible to create a digest of the whole ELF
file.

Alternatively, we need to create a digest of the "relevant content".This can be compared to a "normalization" process,
like one would do it when signing XML or JSON content.

[IMPORTANT]
.Relevant content
====
It is important that the digest includes all information that is relevant.While some parts of the file cannot be part
of the digest process, it must be ensured that a possible attacker cannot modify parts of the un-digested parts of the
file in a way that might circumvent the validation process.
====

The following parts (in the listed order), are part of the digest:

* Header
  ** Entry address
* The data range of all sections
  ** Except for the content of any signature section
  ** Except for the content of the `.shstrtab` section
* The string data of the `.shstrtab` section
  ** Except the strings used by the signature section
* The section headers
  ** Except the section header of any signature section

All data is fed into a digest algorithm in the endian byte order of the ELF binary.

==== Acquiring a private key and certificate

For the signature process, a private key and an X.509 certificate is required.

Using Sigstore, a short-lived certificate is acquired from the Fulcio instance. This certificate is valid for a few
minutes only, but can be used to sign the file.

NOTE: In the future it may be possible to use an existing (long-lived) key & certificate as well.

NOTE: Currently, only ECDSA P256 & SHA256 can be used. SHA384 cannot be used due to a limitation in Rekor.

==== Signing the digest with the private key to generate a signature

In order to create a signature, the existing digest is being signed with the key.

==== Publishing the digest and certificate in a transparency log

The digest, signature, and leaf certificate are being published in the Rekor log, using a "hashedrekord":

[source,json5]
----
{
  "kind": "hashedrekord",
  "apiVersion": "0.0.1",
  "spec": {
    "signature": {
      "content": "MEUCIH/UARGjC1v1yyU7ajpmNJ6/M5tJGnB91QqNVlHwnY4uAiEAhPwm43yMaeKEO4dSfjBZorJeYNoYtsycH49W4nm4DBQ=", // <1>
      "public_key": "" // <2>
    },
    "data": {
      "hash": {
        "algorithm": "sha256", // <3>
        "value": "0ed33c8de2f87f719186438f74485dcf722f5e343154e7a4d29d88bba29bf539" // <4>
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> The base64 encoded signature data in DER format
<2> The base64 encoded, PEM encoded X.509 certificate{empty}footnote:[Yes, this is actually base64 encoded twice through the PEM encoding. And the "certificate" goes into the field "public_key"]
<3> Fixed `sha256`. Currently, only `sha1` and `sha256` seem supported by Rekor. So we can only work with SHA256.
<4> The base16 encoded digest

The entry is created through an API call to `/api/v1/log/entries` using `POST` and the above payload. This will
result in a "log entry" like this:

[source,json5]
----
{
  "uuid": "24296fb24b8ad77a791ce31c919e5966ccdfce4283d6425b20de98003f12e06970c8be053c73308c", // <1>
  "body": "â€¦", // <2>
  "logId": "",
  "logIndex": 0,
  "integratedTime": 1674655787, // <3>
  "verification": {
    "signedEntryTimestamp": "" // <4>
  },
}
----
<1> A unique ID of the log entry (not a UUID)
<2> The `hashedrekord` from the request, base64 encoded
<3> Unix timestamp of the log entry
<4> A base64 encoded signature of the digest of `body`, `integratedTime`, `logId`, and `logIndex`, signed with the
Rekor instance's public key

[#signature_data_structure]
==== Signature data structure

The information generated in the previous steps will be encoded into a signature struct and ASN.1 encoded:

[source,asn1]
----
Signature :: = SEQUENCE {
    type ENUMERATED { // <1>
        0, // ECDSA P256 + SHA256
        1  // ECDSA P384 + SHA384
    }
    publicKey OCTET STRING // <2>
    signature OCTET STRING // <3>
    certificateBundle SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING // <4>
    rekor OPTIONAL SEQUENCE {
        entryId OCTET STRING
    }
}
----
<1> The type of the signature (impacts publicKey and signature format)
<2> The public key, encoded in its format
<3> The signature, encoded in its format

The public key and signature encoding are ASN.1/DER in the case of ECDSA.Other types, which are currently not specified
might have different encoding.That is why it is declared as `OCTET STRING`.

[#embedding_information_into_the_elf_binary]
==== Embedding information into the ELF binary

The (ASN.1) encoded signature entries are encoded as "notes" in a "notes section" of the ELF binary.

==== Notes section details

The name of the section is `.note.signature-v1`.There must be only one section with this name in the file.

There may be multiple note entries in this section.A signature entry has the namespace `Signature` and the type
`0` (for ASN.1 encoded signature).

It is possible to have other entries (and other namespaces) in this file, however they will be ignored.

The descriptor (data) of the note entry is the ASN.1 encoded information from as described
in <<signature_data_structure>>.

==== Steps for adding the notes section

As this means adding a new notes section, it also means altering the structure of the file, without breaking it.

The required steps are:

* Add a new string table entry for the section string table (`.note.signature-v1`)
* Add a new notes section

The following steps are performed to add the notes section:

* Copy the existing `.shrstrtab` section to the end of the file
* Append a string table entry for `.note.signature-v1`
* Append the signature data to the end of the file
* Copy the existing section headers to the end of the file, removing any existing signature notes section
* Append a new section header for the signature notes section
* Update the `.shrstrtab` offset and length in the header
* Update the section header offset (`e_shoff`) and num (`e_shnum`) in the ELF file header

This is a minimal invasive approach. It leaves all the data in place, creates copies (appending additions) of the
altered parts, and adjusts the pointers in the file header. While this leaves the old data in place, this is ok for
ELF files, as it uses pointers (offsets) to point to the correct data. However, it doesn't even touch all the other
content.

=== Verifying a signature

The following steps need to take in order to verify a signature:

* Create a digest of the ELF binary
* Extract the signature information
* Verify the signature information
* Verify the certificate transparency log

Creating a digest works exactly as described before in <<creating_a_digest_of_the_elf_binary>>.

TIP: During the process, if something goes wrong, a field cannot be parsed, information is missing, then the current
step will be considered failed. This doesn't need to fail the whole operation, but at least the processing of the
current item. In the end, this may lead to an overall failure, due to a lack of information.

==== Extracting the signature information

The file is scanned for a notes section containing signature information. This is a reverse process of the
process described in <<embedding_information_into_the_elf_binary>>.

NOTE: The information extract cannot be trusted before it was verified.

==== Verifying the signature information

The extracted signature information is verified as follows:

* Verify the evaluated digest (of the signed binary) with the public key and signature from the signature entry
+
=> This tells us if the file was signed with this public key. However, we cannot yet trust the public key.
* Compare the public key from the signature entry with the public key from the certificate in the signature entry
+
This is a bit of a redundancy. However, it allows one to check the signature without parsing the full certificate
{empty}footnote:[Might consider dropping the redundancy and use the public key from the certificate, now that we use
DER encoding anyway].
+
=> This tells us if the certificate was the one that provided the public key.

Next, the certificate chain is evaluated:

* Verify that the certificate bundle builds a chain, or is a self-signed certificate
  ** Starting from first to last, ensure that each subject is signed by its issuer (the next certificate in the chain)
  ** Ensure that root and intermediate certificates have the "CA" flag set
  ** NOTE: A bunch of more tests, but don't test the validity period
* Ensure that the root certificate (or self-signed) is one that we consider "trusted"

[NOTE]
.Validity period check
====
We cannot check the validity period of the certificates, because that would mean that binaries that are out of
the validity period would no longer be valid. Having a short-lived certificate might mean that this would already be
the case a few minutes after the file was signed.

Having a validity check against "now" makes sense when e.g. establishing a connection. As we want to ensure that the
remote side can _now_ prove to use that it knows the private key.

In the case of code-signing, we however want to prove that the issuer knew the private key at the point in time when
the binary was signed, not when we want to inspect or run it.
====

=> This tells us that the ELF binary was signed with a public key that was signed by a root that we consider
trustworthy. However, we don't know "when" this happened, as we skipped the validity period check.

==== Verifying the certificate transparency log

===== Offline mode

To be written â€¦

But I think this boils down to storing the log entry inside the ELF binary, and using this, instead of fetching it
from rekor.

Continue with <<performing_the_validation>>.

===== Online mode

Using the encoded "entry ID" field from the "rekor" bundle information, which comes from the signature entry of the ELF
binary, we fetch the log entry and the public key from the public Rekor instance.

Continue with <<performing_the_validation>>.

[#performing_the_validation]
===== Perform the validation

First, we need to validate the rekor log entry:

* *FIXME:* "verify inclusion"
* *FIXME:* "verify checkpoint signature"
* Verify the signed time data (SET)
+
--
  ** Build a normalized (JCS) object of `logId`, `logIndex`, `body` and `integratedTimestamp`
  ** Digest the object and validate the signature using Rekor's public key
--
+
=> From this we know that the combination of `logId`, `logIndex`, `body` and `integratedTimestamp` has been signed
by Rekor at the time of the "integrated timestamp".

WARNING: Don't we miss a link between the "uuid" and the signature of the log entry here?

Next, we can correlate the ELF binary signature with the log entry:

* Verify that the certificate from the log entry's body structure is the same as the leaf/first certificate of the
  certificate bundle in the signature entry
  => With this we know that the certificate was presented to the Rekor instance at the time of `integratedTimestamp`
* Verify that the validity period of the leaf/first certificate was valid at the time of `integratedTimestamp`
  => With this we know that the certificate was valid at the time it was presented to the Rekor instance

WARNING: We still need a correlation between the current digest of the file and the log entry. We should compare the
evaluated digest of the file with the digest/hash stored in the log entry, which got signed by Rekor.



[appendix]
== Alternatives

The goals mentioned above could also be achieves through alternative approaches. Here is some reasoning.

=== Adjacent signatures

> Why not just sign the whole blob? Just create a signature file?

That has already been done. But is not really being used.

That a look a Maven signing: each Maven artifact gets signed. That is even a requirement for uploading it to maven
central. However, most people do not verify those signatures.

On the other side, JARs have been signed in the past. And that technology saw some adoption. Same for signed RPMs.

True, the fact that signature information is adjacent to the actual artifact isn't the only factor contribution to the
non-adoption. However, I strongly believe that tooling is. RPMs get validated automatically during the installation
process. Same for signed JARs, when installing Eclipse IDE plugins. Or think about a Windows (or macOS) binary. That
process happens automatically, and the user actually needs to opt-out of the process.

Just imagine users would need to download an additional `.sig` file for Windows binaries.

So embedding the signatures makes the process more complex on the technical side, but simpler on the user side. Which
might be a factor for increasing adoption.

=== Re-using an existing packager manager

RPM in combination with YUM/DNF already provides a way to get binaries from a supplier to a user. It is also possible
to verify the integrity of the file later on. Not only the binary itself, but also all kinds of file which might be
shipped alongside the binary.

It also is possible to create RPMs for "custom applications", which are not part of the OS distribution. Having the
same features.

The downside is, that different distributions use different package managers. So a supplier has additional work to do,
in order to support multiple package managers. This results in people just publishing binaries through GitHub releases.

Using `elfsign`, the same artifact can be shipped to multiple Linux flavours.
